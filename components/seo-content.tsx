      <h2>Email Security Scanner - Verify SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and BIMI Records</h2>
      <p>
        Our free domain security scanner analyzes your domain's email authentication 
        protocols including SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), 
        DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance), and BIMI 
        (Brand Indicators for Message Identification). Scan your domain now to check if 
        your email security is properly configured.
      </p>

      <h3>What is SPF (Sender Policy Framework)?</h3>
      <p>
        SPF is an email authentication method that specifies which mail servers are 
        authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain. Our domain scanner checks 
        your SPF records to ensure they are correctly configured and help prevent email 
        spoofing and phishing attacks.
      </p>

      <h3>What is DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)?</h3>
      <p>
        DKIM adds a digital signature to your emails to verify that they haven't been 
        tampered with during transit. Our free domain scanner verifies your DKIM 
        configuration to ensure your emails are properly signed and authenticated.
      </p>

      <h3>What is DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)?</h3>
      <p>
        DMARC is an email authentication protocol that uses SPF and DKIM to determine 
        the authenticity of an email message. Our domain security scanner checks your 
        DMARC policy to help protect your domain from email fraud and improve your 
        email deliverability.
      </p>

      <h3>What is BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification)?</h3>
      <p>
        BIMI allows you to display your brand logo in email clients that support it. 
        Our email security scanner verifies your BIMI configuration to help enhance 
        your brand visibility and email trustworthiness.
